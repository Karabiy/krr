# Sprint 3-4: CRD Phase 1 Implementation

**Author:** Assistant  
**Date:** 2025-01-28  
**Status:** Completed  
**Sprint:** 3-4 (Q1 2025)  

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented CRD (Custom Resource Definition) support for KRR, completing all four objectives:
1. ✅ Implemented CRD formatter
2. ✅ Defined CRD schemas  
3. ✅ Generate CRDs alongside reports
4. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

This enables GitOps workflows, audit trails, and future automation capabilities for KRR recommendations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. CRD Formatter Implementation

**File:** `robusta_krr/formatters/crd.py` (New)

Created a new formatter that outputs recommendations as Kubernetes CRDs:
- Generates individual `ResourceRecommendation` CRDs for each workload/container
- Creates an aggregated `RecommendationReport` CRD per scan
- Includes all recommendation data, metrics, and analysis metadata
- Calculates estimated cost savings (basic formula included)
- Proper YAML formatting with document separators

**Key Features:**
- Unique naming scheme: `{workload}-{container}-{timestamp}`
- Comprehensive labels for filtering and querying
- Confidence scores based on severity
- Cost estimation in monthly dollars

### 2. CRD Schema Definitions

**Files:**
- `manifests/crds/resourcerecommendation-crd.yaml` (New)
- `manifests/crds/recommendationreport-crd.yaml` (New)

Defined two CRDs with full OpenAPI v3 schemas:

**ResourceRecommendation CRD:**
- Represents individual workload recommendations
- Includes targetRef, recommendations, analysis, and impact sections
- Status tracking for approval workflow
- Custom printer columns for kubectl output

**RecommendationReport CRD:**
- Aggregates all recommendations from a scan
- Summary statistics by namespace and severity
- Links to individual recommendations
- Scan metadata and error tracking

### 3. Documentation

**Files:**
- `docs/crd-usage.md` (New) - Comprehensive usage guide
- `manifests/crds/README.md` (New) - CRD installation guide
- `examples/crd-example.sh` (New) - Interactive demo script
- `manifests/crds/install.sh` (New) - Installation script

Created extensive documentation covering:
- Installation instructions
- Basic and advanced usage
- GitOps workflows
- Filtering and querying
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting
- Future enhancements

### 4. Example and Helper Scripts

**Interactive Demo:** `examples/crd-example.sh`
- Step-by-step walkthrough of CRD usage
- Covers installation, generation, viewing, and cleanup
- Safe with confirmation prompts

**Installation Script:** `manifests/crds/install.sh`
- Checks prerequisites
- Installs both CRDs
- Verifies installation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Generate recommendations as CRDs
krr simple -f crd --fileoutput recommendations.yaml

# Apply to cluster
kubectl apply -f recommendations.yaml

# View recommendations
kubectl get resourcerecommendations -A
kubectl get recommendationreports -A
```

### GitOps Workflow
```bash
# Generate and commit to Git
krr simple -f crd --fileoutput k8s/recommendations/$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml
git add k8s/recommendations/
git commit -m "KRR recommendations - $(date)"
git push

# Apply via ArgoCD/Flux
```

### Filtering
```bash
# Find critical recommendations
kubectl get rr -A -l krr.robusta.dev/severity=critical

# Find recommendations for deployments
kubectl get rr -A -l krr.robusta.dev/workload-kind=deployment
```

## Technical Implementation

### CRD Structure
```yaml
# ResourceRecommendation
apiVersion: krr.robusta.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ResourceRecommendation
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment-nginx-20240128-141523
  labels:
    krr.robusta.dev/severity: warning
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx-deployment
  recommendations:
    containers:
    - name: nginx
      resources:
        cpu: {request: "100m", limit: "500m"}
        memory: {request: "128Mi", limit: "512Mi"}
  analysis:
    strategy: simple
    confidence: 0.95
  impact:
    estimatedSavings:
      cpu: "400m"
      memory: "384Mi"
```

### Integration Points
- Works with existing KRR workflow
- No breaking changes
- New formatter registered as 'crd'
- Compatible with all strategies

## Benefits Achieved

1. **GitOps Ready**: Recommendations as versionable K8s resources
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete history via Git and K8s audit logs
3. **Native Integration**: Use kubectl, K8s RBAC, and standard tools
4. **Future Ready**: Foundation for controllers and automation
5. **Flexible Workflows**: Supports various organizational processes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **CRD Installation:**
   - Test on different K8s versions
   - Verify RBAC requirements
   - Check CRD validation

2. **Formatter Output:**
   - Test with various workload types
   - Verify YAML validity
   - Check naming uniqueness

3. **Documentation:**
   - Run through example script
   - Test all command examples
   - Verify GitOps workflow

## Next Steps

With CRD Phase 1 complete, future phases can build on this foundation:
- **Phase 2**: Basic controller for auto-application
- **Phase 3**: Policy-based automation
- **Controller**: Watch and apply recommendations
- **Webhooks**: Integration with external systems

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes
- CRD formatter is opt-in via `-f crd`
- CRDs must be installed before use
- Existing workflows unchanged

## Conclusion

The CRD implementation transforms KRR from a reporting tool into a platform for recommendation lifecycle management. It enables sophisticated workflows while maintaining simplicity for basic usage. The foundation is now in place for advanced automation features in future sprints.
