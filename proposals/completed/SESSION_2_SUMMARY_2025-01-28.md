# Session 2 Summary - Cost Integration Analysis (2025-01-28)

## Overview
This session focused on understanding and documenting the gap in KRR's cost integration functionality, specifically answering the question: "How does KRR determine instance types when querying the Vantage API?"

## Key Discovery
**The cost integration is incomplete** - while the infrastructure exists (cost providers, API clients, CLI options), the critical link between workload scanning and cost querying is missing.

## Work Completed

### 1. Created NodeMapper Infrastructure
- **File**: `robusta_krr/core/integrations/kubernetes/node_mapper.py`
- **Purpose**: Extract instance types from Kubernetes node labels
- **Features**:
  - Caches node information for performance
  - Supports multiple label patterns (standard and legacy)
  - Detects cloud provider from node's providerID
  - Handles AWS-specific labels

### 2. Documentation Created

#### Instance Type Detection Guide
- **File**: `docs/instance-type-detection.md`
- Comprehensive guide on finding instance types in Kubernetes
- Cloud-specific commands (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Troubleshooting steps for missing labels
- PowerShell script for Windows users

#### Cost Integration Flow
- **File**: `docs/cost-integration-flow.md`
- Detailed explanation of how cost integration should work
- Visual flow diagram (Mermaid)
- Code examples of the missing integration
- Implementation priorities

#### Cost Integration Answer
- **File**: `docs/cost-integration-answer.md`
- Direct answer to the user's question
- Clear explanation of what's implemented vs missing
- The exact code gap in `runner.py`

### 3. PowerShell Script
- **File**: `scripts/detect-instance-types.ps1`
- Windows-compatible script to detect node instance types
- Colored output and summary statistics
- CSV export option

## The Missing Integration

The gap is in `runner.py` around line 232 in `_calculate_object_recommendations`:

```python
# What's missing:
1. Load all nodes and cache their instance types
2. For each workload, find which nodes its pods run on
3. Extract instance type from those nodes
4. Query cost provider with instance type
5. Attach cost data to recommendations
```

## Next Steps (Sprint 6.5)

To complete the cost integration:
1. Integrate `NodeMapper` into `KubernetesLoader`
2. Add workload-to-node mapping in `runner.py`
3. Connect cost provider queries to recommendation calculations
4. Test with real Kubernetes clusters

## Impact
Without this integration:
- Cost provider is configured but never used
- Vantage API is never called with instance types
- Cost features remain non-functional despite being implemented
