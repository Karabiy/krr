# KRR Roadmap

Based on the analysis and proposals, here's a suggested implementation roadmap for KRR enhancements.

## Q1 2025 - Foundation & Quick Wins

### Sprint 1-2: Quick Wins ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-28)
- [x] Export to Kubernetes YAML manifests
- [x] Add summary statistics (total savings)
- [x] Configuration file support (.krr.yaml)
- [x] Progress indicators for long scans

See [Sprint 1-2 Implementation](completed/SPRINT_1_2_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details.

### Sprint 3-4: CRD Phase 1 ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-28)
- [x] Implement CRD formatter
- [x] Define CRD schemas
- [x] Generate CRDs alongside reports
- [x] Documentation for CRD usage

See [Sprint 3-4 Implementation](completed/SPRINT_3_4_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details.

## Q2 2025 - Enhanced Analytics

### Sprint 5-6: Cost Integration ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED (2025-01-28)
- [x] Cloud provider pricing APIs (Vantage for AWS)
- [x] Cost-aware recommendation strategy
- [x] Dollar-based savings calculations
- [x] Cost reports in multiple currencies
- [x] **NEW**: NodeMapper infrastructure for instance type detection
- [x] **NEW**: Documentation on instance type detection methods
- [ ] **PENDING**: Integration between workload scanning and cost querying

**Today's Progress (2025-01-28 - Session 2):**
- Created `NodeMapper` class for extracting instance types from Kubernetes nodes
- Documented the missing integration between workload scanning and cost providers
- Created guides for detecting instance types in various cloud environments
- Identified the exact code gap preventing cost queries from working

See [Sprint 5-6 Implementation](completed/SPRINT_5_6_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details.

### Sprint 6.5: Complete Cost Integration (NEW)
- [ ] Integrate NodeMapper into KubernetesLoader
- [ ] Add workload-to-node mapping in runner.py
- [ ] Connect cost provider queries to recommendation calculations
- [ ] Test end-to-end cost flow with real clusters

### Sprint 7-8: Advanced Strategies
- [ ] ML-based strategy (prototype)
- [ ] Seasonality detection
- [ ] Spike vs sustained usage detection
- [ ] Strategy comparison tools

## Q3 2025 - Platform Integration

### Sprint 9-10: CRD Phase 2
- [ ] Basic recommendation controller
- [ ] Approval workflow
- [ ] RBAC integration
- [ ] GitOps examples

### Sprint 11-12: Monitoring & Alerts
- [ ] Watch mode implementation
- [ ] Webhook notifications
- [ ] Prometheus metrics export
- [ ] Alert rule templates

## Q4 2025 - Enterprise Features

### Sprint 13-14: Advanced Resources
- [ ] GPU resource support
- [ ] Custom metrics integration
- [ ] Network I/O analysis
- [ ] Storage IOPS recommendations

### Sprint 15-16: CRD Phase 3
- [ ] Policy-based automation
- [ ] Progressive rollout strategies
- [ ] Full monitoring integration
- [ ] Multi-cluster support

## 2026 - Future Vision

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Kubernetes Operator
- [ ] AI-powered insights
- [ ] Predictive scaling
- [ ] Full FinOps platform integration

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 10,000+ active users by end of 2025
- **Savings**: Average 40% cost reduction for users
- **Integration**: Support for top 5 cloud providers
- **Community**: 50+ contributors

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- Kubernetes 1.24+ for CRD v1 support
- Prometheus 2.30+ for new metrics
- Cloud provider API stability

### Risks
- Performance at scale (>1000 nodes)
- Cloud pricing API changes
- Kubernetes API deprecations

## Community Involvement

- Monthly community calls
- Proposal review process
- Beta testing program
- Conference presentations
